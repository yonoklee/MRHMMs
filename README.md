MRHMMs 


1. Install gsl and openmp libraries. The following links may be helpful.

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/


2. Unzip the MRHMMs.zip file

> unzip MRHMMs.zip

3. Edit Makefile as needed (Location of gsl library may need to change) and 

> make 

4. Test if MRHMMs is working  (HMM.initial and data sets are included
in the zip file)

> ./MRHMMs HMM.initial


If it runs, now you need to change HMM.initial file to run your own
model. Good luck!
